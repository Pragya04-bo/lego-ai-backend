# 🧩 LEGO.AI — Multi-Agent Developer Assistant

**LEGO.AI** is a modular **multi-agent AI system** designed to help developers transform ideas into production-ready software faster.

Inspired by LEGO blocks, each AI agent performs a specialized task and can be combined with others to create a powerful developer workflow.

This project demonstrates how multiple AI agents can collaborate to assist developers with:

- 🔎 Discovering relevant GitHub repositories
- ⚡ Optimizing and improving code
- 🌍 Finding hackathons and opportunities to implement ideas

---

# 🚀 Features

## 🔎 Repo Discovery Agent
Finds **similar GitHub repositories** using semantic similarity of README files.

Capabilities:
- Extract README from a repository
- Generate embeddings
- Find semantically similar repositories
- Help developers discover reusable codebases

---

## ⚡ Code Optimization Agent
Analyzes user code and suggests improvements.

Capabilities:
- Detect inefficient coding patterns
- Perform AST-based static analysis
- Identify potential errors
- Auto-format code using PEP8 standards

---

## 🌍 Opportunity Finder Agent
Helps developers **discover hackathons and competitions** related to their ideas.

Capabilities:
- Extract keywords using Azure Language Service
- Generate relevant search queries
- Search the internet for hackathons and coding competitions

Each agent functions independently and can be extended or replaced without affecting the system — just like LEGO blocks.

# 📡 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `/api/discover` | Discover similar GitHub repositories |
| `/api/optimize-code` | Analyze and optimize code |
| `/api/find-opportunities` | Find hackathons and competitions |
| `/api/lego-agent` | Run all agents together |

---

# 🧪 Example Request

```

POST /api/lego-agent

````

Example input:

```json
{
 "repo_url": "https://github.com/django/django",
 "code": "for i in range(len(arr)): print(arr[i])",
 "idea": "AI system for crop disease detection"
}
````

# 💡 Why LEGO.AI?

Developers often lose productive time due to:

* Searching for relevant codebases
* Understanding unfamiliar repositories
* Improving code quality
* Finding platforms to implement ideas

LEGO.AI reduces this friction by **automating discovery, optimization, and opportunity exploration through AI agents**.

---

# 🔮 Future Improvements

* Integrate Azure OpenAI for intelligent code suggestions
* Use Azure AI Search for scalable vector search
* Deploy agents as independent microservices
* Integrate with GitHub Copilot Extensions

If you want, I can also show you **3 small things that make the README look much more “hackathon-winning”** (badges, screenshots, and architecture diagram).
